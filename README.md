# AI-Based Network Security Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project implements an AI-based system for real-time network security fraud detection, emphasizing the role of linear algebra in artificial intelligence. The system is designed to detect four major types of security anomalies:

- DoS/DDoS (Denial of Service) Attacks
- R2L (Remote to Local) Attacks  
- Probe Attacks
- U2R (User to Root) Attacks

## Features

- Real-time anomaly detection
- Multiple ML model implementations:
  - Random Forest (with and without RFE)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
  - Decision Trees
  - Ensemble Learning (Voting Classifier)
- Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Comprehensive model evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Visual analytics through confusion matrices and performance comparisons

## Implementation Details

The project is implemented as a Jupyter notebook using Python and key machine learning libraries:
- pandas & numpy for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning models
- seaborn & matplotlib for visualization
- NSL-KDD dataset for training and testing
